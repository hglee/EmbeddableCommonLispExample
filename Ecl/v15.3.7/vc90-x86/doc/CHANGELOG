ECL 13.7.1
==========

* Errors fixed:

- DEFUN functions not defined as toplevel forms were also directly referenced
  other code in the same file.

* Extensions:

- In compiled code it is possible to declare variables to have a C type
  such as in (declare (:double a)) and then the variable is enforced to
  be unboxed to such type.

- New form EXT:C-PROGN used to interleave C statements with lisp code, where
  the lisp code may refer to any number of variables. Example:

	(lambda (i)
	  (let* ((limit i)
	  	 (iterator 0))
	    (declare (:int limit iterator))
	    (ffi:c-progn (limit iterator)
	      "for (#1 = 0; #1 < #0; #1++) {"
	      (print iterator)
	      "}")))
